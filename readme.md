# gmapping
you can change the world in the **gazebo.launch** file and run  
`roslaunch simple_robot_description gmapping.launch`   
or  
`roslaunch planar_move_gmapping gmapping.launch`   
click the terminal where the teleop key runs and move the robot around with "ijkl,"

## save map
PS: don't close gazebo and rviz before you haven't saved the map  
cd into folder to save the map  
`rosrun map_server map_saver -f battlefield`

# SLAM navigation
the map and the world need to match, you can change the map in the **navigation.launch** file and run  
`roslaunch simple_robot_description navigation.launch`   
or   
`roslaunch planar_move_navigation navigation.launch`
